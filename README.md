# Hi there üëã

I'm a recent MSc graduate in Big Data Driven Networked Systems from the [Ionian University Department of Informatics](https://di.ionio.gr/en/), also holding a BSc in Informatics from the same institution. My academic journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in technology and a keen aptitude for tackling complex problems. I've honed my skills in mobile and web application development, delivering innovative and quality solutions.

I thrive in collaborative settings, where I can apply my theoretical knowledge and technical skills to contribute meaningfully and grow within a dynamic working environment. I'm driven by a constant desire to learn and expand my skillset, aiming to develop projects that are not only impressive but also impactful.
